title: Command Parsing
---

Drop uses a cross-platform, POSIX inspired command parsing for a consistent way to define launch commands in a single string.

The basic format is:

```bash
MY_ENV_KEY=myvalue MY_OTHER_ENV_KEY=myothervalue mycommand --myargs --myotherargs "other string"
```

Drop will split this into three parts:
| | |
| - | - |
| Environment variables | Collects anything that has a `=` at the start. (`MY_ENV_KEY=myvalue MY_OTHER_ENV_KEY=myothervalue`) |
| Command | The next value (`mycommand`) |
| Arguments | Everything else (`--myargs --myotherargs "other string"`) |

These will be passed in platform-specific process creation functions.

## Platform-specific behaviour

On Linux and macOS (Unix), the command will be reassembled into a single string, and then executed on the system shell, meaning shell expansions and other utilities work. Drop will respect quotes (`"`) to preserve spaces.

On Windows, the command isn't reassembled, and environment variables, command, and args are passed directly to the process creation.

## Format args

| Key         | Value description                                                                  |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `{dir}`     | The current working directory/install directory.                                   |
| `{exe}`     | The relative name of the executable. The command from above parsing.               |
| `{abs_exe}` | The absolute path of the executable, the command appended to the install directory |
