title: Building Drop client
---

To build the client, you need:

- Node.js, and the `pnpm` package manager
- Rust (nightly)

import { Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<Steps>
1. ### Clone the repo

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Drop-OSS/drop-app.git && cd drop-app
    ```

    We also include some libraries as submodules. Clone them too:

    ```bash
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    ```

2. ### Install build system dependencies

    Use `pnpm` to install the dependencies for our bespoke build system:

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3. ### Run the build

    Use `tauri` to build the app:

    ```bash
    pnpm tauri build
    ```

    :::note
    If you don't have certain system libraries, the Rust build will fail. Install them, and re-run the build.
