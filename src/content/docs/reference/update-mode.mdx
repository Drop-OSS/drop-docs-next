title: Update Mode

import { FileTree } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Update mode allows admins to store multiple versions of a game, without needing to store duplicate files.

In practice, update mode _pastes_ versions over each other to create the final content. This is particularly useful, as many updates that are not provided through distribution networks are provided as patches.

## Example

Let's say you have the following version setup:

<FileTree>
- mygame
    - v1.0.0
        - mygame.exe
        - content1.zip
        - content2.zip
        - content3.zip
    - v1.5.3
        - content2.zip
        - content3.zip
    - v1.9.1
        - mygame.exe
        - content3.zip

</FileTree>

With versions `v1.0.0`, `v1.5.3`, `v1.9.1` imported in order, where v1.9.1 has the highest priority.


If versions `v1.5.3` and `v1.9.1` are set in **update mode**, when the user downloads the latest version (`v1.9.1`), they get:
<FileTree>
- mygame-v1.9.1
    - mygame.exe *v1.9.1*
    - content1.zip *v1.0.0*
    - content2.zip *v1.5.3*
    - context3.zip *v1.9.1*
</FileTree>

As you can see, the files in the newer versions overwrite the files from the older versions.
