title: Creating a library

To import games and start using Drop, you must first create a library to import from.

<Steps>

1. **Decide on a library layout.**

   Drop supports different layouts for your files on disk, you can read more about them in the [Library Sources](/reference/library-sources) reference section.

2. **Mount your library in the Docker container.**

   For Drop to access your library, you must mount it within the Docker container.

   ```diff
   drop:
    image: ghcr.io/drop-oss/drop:latest
    ...
    volumes:
   +  - /mnt/media/my-drop-library:/library
   ```

   Where:
   - `/mnt/media/my-drop-library` is the path to your library.
   - `/library` is a **unique** path inside the container. **Use something else if another volume mounts to `/library`**.

   If you followed the [Quickstart](/admin/quickstart/) guide, you'll have already set up a library at `./library` pointing to `/library` within the container. You may want to instead edit that line in the `volumes` section to point to where your library is located.

3. **Open library source interface in Admin Dashboard.**

   Head to your admin dashboard, and click on the "Library" tab. Then, in the top rightmost corner, click on "Sources".

4. **Create your library source.**

   Use the "Create" button in the top right to create your library source. Use the **path from inside the container** when providing the path for the library, like `/library` from Step 2.

</Steps>
