Once you've got a library set up, you can import a game.

## Set up metadata providers

Drop's metadata provider system allows you to import from a variety of metadata sources from one interface. **By default, there are a couple metadata providers that require no configuration to be activated.** You can use those for now.

If you'd like to configure more metadata providers, use the metadata section on the sidebar to view individual configurations for each provider.

## Importing a game

<Steps>
1. **Create your game folder.**

    Following your chosen library structure, create a game folder with a name similar _enough_ to the published title of your game.

    For example, if your game is called "STAR WARS: Jedi Survivor - Deluxe Edition", you can usually get away with just "Jedi Survivor".

2. **Open import interface.**

   Once you've created your game folder, open the Admin Dashboard, and navigate to the "Library" tab. **Drop should detect you have a new game to import**, and display an alert. **Use the "Import" button to proceed.**

   All games in Drop must be **manually imported** - there is no automatic library matching. However, some automation tools may use the Drop API to automatically import games and versions on your behalf.

   If Drop does not detect your new game folder, double check your library structure and library source configuration. If the issue persists, hop into our Discord or open an issue on GitHub.

3. **Select your game folder.**

   From the dropdown at the top of the page, select your game folder.

   This starts a metadata search, using the name of the folder. Results will appear in another dropdown, in which you can select the correct option. You can also edit the search parameters and click Search again, to refine your results. Once you've found the correct option, click "Import".

   You can also skip this process by using the manual metadata provider, by clicking "Import without metadata"

   :::tip
   **Bulk import mode** can be used to import many games in succession. It turns off the redirect to the imoprt task.

4. **Wait for import.**

   Once you've clicked import, Drop will redirect you to the import task. It will show the progress and any log messages about the import.

   :::note
   The import happens in the background, so you can leave the page without worrying about cancelling the import.
