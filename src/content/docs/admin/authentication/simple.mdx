Simple authentication (or simple auth) is a basic username and password combination. It's the default for Drop, and is the fallback authentication mechanism if Drop is unable to initialise any others.

Simple authentication works on a system of invites.

## Creating an Invite

<Steps>
1. Head to your Drop Admin dashboard, and click on the **'Users' tab.**

2. Then, head to the authentication panel by **clicking the 'Authentication &rarr;' button.**

3. Then, **click on the "Simple" auth**, **click the three-dot menu**, and **"Configure"**. 

4. Then, create an invite with the button and modal.

</Steps>

## Disabling Simple Auth

If you've configured another authentication mechanism, you can disable simple by setting the environment variable `DISABLE_SIMPLE_AUTH` to "true".
