title: Importing an update
---

import { Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

If you're using a library source that supports versioning, you can add and import an update for your game! There are two ways to do it:

- Overwrite: completely overwrites the previous version. Simpliest to understand and use.
- Update-mode: patches the previous version's files, while providing new configuration.

## Overwrite

<Steps>
1. ### Add your new files

    Add your new files, making note of the folder structure of your library source.

2. ### Follow the import guide again

   Follow the [import guide again](/admin/guides/import-version/), but this time for your new version folder.

</Steps>

## Update mode

You may noticed a toggle in the version import UI called "update mode". This enables update mode, which:

- takes the files from your new version
- takes the files from your old version
- pastes the new files over the old files, overwriting where they conflict

You can stack many "update mode" versions on top of each other, and they will pick up files from all of them.

<Steps>
1. ### Add your new files

    Add your new files, making note of the folder structure of your library source.

2. ### Follow the import guide again

   Follow the [import guide again](/admin/guides/import-version/), but this time for your new version folder.

3. ### Before import, enable update mode

   Click the toggle for "Update mode"

</Steps>
