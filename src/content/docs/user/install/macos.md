To install on macOS, download the `.dmg` image for your device from [our website](https://droposs.org/download). M-chips are ARM, Intel chips are x86.

Open the `.dmg` file. If macOS shows that the `.dmg` is unsigned, follow the macOS method to allow it on your system.

Then, copy "Drop Desktop Client" to your Applications folder.
