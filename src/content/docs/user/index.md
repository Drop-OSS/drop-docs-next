Drop clients are available for download from [our website](https://droposs.org/download), or follow one of our installation guides on the sidebar. Download the correct version for your platform, and open it up.

The client will walk you through the setup and sign-in process to get started. You'll need a Drop instance you can connect to, and an account on the server. If you don't have one, you can follow the [Quickstart](/admin/quickstart/) guide to set up your own.
